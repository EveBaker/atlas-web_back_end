# Project Title: Pagination 

## Resources

**Read or Watch:**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without external resources:

- How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters.
- How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata.
- How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner.

## Requirements

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **python3 (version 3.7)**.
- Every file should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should adhere to the **pycodestyle style (version 2.5.*)**.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- All your modules should have documentation (accessed using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your functions should have documentation (accessed using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`).
- Documentation must be meaningful and explain the purpose of the module, class, or method.
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
